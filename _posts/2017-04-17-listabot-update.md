Now at a glance you can see how long a task has been worked on, or not worked on.

At the top of each task detail there is a percentage of project time utilized. 
This letâ€™s you know which tasks are utilizing the most of the currently selected projectss total time.

And of course, you can still select which types of times are rendered by simply tapping <em>Unstarted</em>, <em>Active</em>, <em>Paused</em>, or <em>Completed</em>.
