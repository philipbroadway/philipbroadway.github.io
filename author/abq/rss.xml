	     <p>I recently moved across country from Spokane Washington to Albuquerque New Mexico in search of a first home after the covid madness. I was drawn to the high elevation for running as well as adobe style houses that are native American culture, hatch peppers which have become synonymous with this area since they originated here &amp; Native american artisans who make beautiful pottery and jewelry in Albuquerque!</p>

<p>Living at 5000 feet above sea level has been a great running environment. I’ve only done a few races but all have been at lower elevations that where i train at La Luz and I’ve felt the difference breathing!</p>

<p>Now after hibernating after winter I need to start ramping up my weekly runs. This week I’ll start by running 3 miles per workday, incrementing the daily mileage by 1 mile each week.</p>
