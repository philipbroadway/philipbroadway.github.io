	     <p>Today I released my first public version of <a href="http://www.listabot.com">Listabot</a> in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/listabot/id1212689677">App Store</a></p>

<p>I’ve contracted &amp; freelanced on &amp; off for many years.</p>

<p>Over the course of those years I’ve used many different platforms for tracking billable hours.</p>

<p>Most require an account to setup before you can even enter a task and actually get to work.</p>

<p>In a small team environment, you might even end up assigning one person to just master the system.</p>

<p>That sole person would then be responsible for assigning &amp; maintaining the tasks.</p>

<p>The Taskmaster.</p>

<p>It’s ironic that something used to track time, could actually end up wasting so much of your time. 
Your team’s time.</p>

<p>Except that wasted time isn’t just a hassle - those are billable hours you’ve just lost.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/blog/listabot-v1.01/new-challenger.jpg" alt="Screen shot from Street Fighter of a new challenger appearing" /></p>

<p>I’ve made  <a href="http://www.listabot.com">Listabot</a> to minimize the friction for simply tracking your billable hours spent on project tasks.</p>

<p>The benefits for tracking your billable hours become apparent over time.</p>

<p>Obviously, tracking your billable hours is important if you want to get paid for your work.</p>

<p>But <em>how</em> you track your time can also save time when you are making estimates for your next project.</p>

<p>With your past performance accurately recorded &amp; easy to analyze, you not only have a record to improve on, but a measuring stick.</p>

<p>This isn’t just your invoice, this is your record to improve upon.
A tool for spotting pain-points &amp; anticipated where more time will be spent.</p>

<p>I have a roadmap of features I’m implementing incrementally.</p>

<p>I’d like to begin adding these features &amp; others as they are requested by users like <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>My mission with this app will always be to keep billable hour tracking <em>simple &amp; intuitive</em>.</p>
